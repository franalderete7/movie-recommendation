# Movie Recommendation System
This project is a part of the Acamica institute in Buenos Aires.

#### -- Project Status: [Completed]

## Project Intro/Objective
The objective of this project is to create a movie recommendation system that will predict the best movie for a given user. The impact of this model is extremely important given the rise of the e-commerce and digital products. 

### Methods Used
* Inferential Statistics
* Data Visualization
* Predictive Modeling
* Machine Learning
* Content-based recommender system

### Technologies
* Python
* Numpy, Pandas, Surprise

## Project Description
MovieLens data sets were collected by the GroupLens Research Project
at the University of Minnesota.
 
This data set consists of:
	* 100,000 ratings (1-5) from 943 users on 1682 movies. 
	* Each user has rated at least 20 movies. 
        * Simple demographic info for the users (age, gender, occupation, zip)

The data was collected through the MovieLens web site
(movielens.umn.edu) during the seven-month period from September 19th, 
1997 through April 22nd, 1998. This data has been cleaned up - users
who had less than 20 ratings or did not have complete demographic
information were removed from this data set.
Making use of this dataset, we'll create a content-based recommender system which will prredict the best movie(s) for a given user.
